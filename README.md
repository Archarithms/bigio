BigIO is a fast messaging framework written entirely in Java.

To get started using BigIO, download the BigIO runtime, and deploy your jar
to the 'components' directory. The API can be used by adding the following to
your Maven pom.

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.bigio</groupId>
    <artifactId>bigio-core</groupId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

A zipped runtime package can be downloaded here: <coming soon>
